# Contributing to Pigeon Finder

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Pigeon Finder as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/your-username/pigeon-finder/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Use descriptive variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Follow PEP 8 for Python code
* Use type hints where appropriate

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

## Development Setup (local)

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a project-local virtual environment (recommended name: `.venv`):

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run tests with pytest before opening a PR:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m pytest -q
```

5. Follow the usual fork/branch/PR workflow and include tests for new features.
